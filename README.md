help these people connect with others and discuss their day, stresses, problems, or anything they want, all while being 
anonymous.

## Installation Instructions

Talk to Me is a website, and requires no installation from the end user. The website can be found at 
[https://talk-to-me.co/](https://talk-to-me.co/landing).
